                    Many of our programs are to some degree <i>deterministic</i>; meaning that if they had the same initial conditions every time they ran, they would produce exactly the same output. Although this can be useful, it is not always be so easy to measure the determinism of our programs.

                    To put this into perspective, think about a cannon ball that was shot into the air. It goes flying thanks to our physics system, and we can trust that it will look somewhat realistic. But how do we predict where it's going to land before it has happened? Given all the relevant conditions, we should be able to calculate its trajectory and collision point before it lands. We can do this by using functions.

                    Calculating trajectories is just one application of functions and curves. There are plenty of other very different uses that we will see throughout this chapter. We will learn how to:
